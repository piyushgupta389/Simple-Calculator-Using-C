# Simple-Calculator-Using-C
# 🧮 Calculator in C

A simple and interactive calculator built using C programming language.  
This project performs basic arithmetic operations and allows continuous calculations until the user chooses to exit.

## 🚀 Features
- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)
- Modulus (%)
- Continuous calculation using loop
- Error handling for division/modulo by zero
- User-friendly terminal interface

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- C Programming Language
- Standard Input/Output (stdio.h)

## 📌 How It Works
1. User selects an operator (+, -, *, /, %)
2. User enters two numbers
3. Program performs the selected operation
4. Result is displayed
5. User can continue calculations until exit

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Install any C compiler (GCC recommended)
2. Save file as `calculator.c`
3. Compile:
## 💻🔥Sample Output
Welcome to the Calculator!

Enter an operator (+, -, *, /, %): +
Enter two numbers: 10 5
10.00 + 5.00 = 15.00

Do you want to continue? (y/n): y

Enter an operator (+, -, *, /, %): *
Enter two numbers: 7 6
7.00 * 6.00 = 42.00

Do you want to continue? (y/n): y

Enter an operator (+, -, *, /, %): /
Enter two numbers: 10 0
Error! Division by zero.

Do you want to continue? (y/n): y

Enter an operator (+, -, *, /, %): %
Enter two numbers: 20 3
20.00 % 3.00 = 2.00

Do you want to continue? (y/n): n

Thank you for using the Calculator. Goodbye!
